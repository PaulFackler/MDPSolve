% randdisc Discrete random variable simulator
% USAGE
%   x = randdisc(p,u,ind);
% INPUTS
%   p   : n x m probability matrix
%   u   : q x 1 vector of random uniform variates
%   ind : q x 1 vector of indices for columns of p (not used if m=1)
% OUTPUT
%   x   : q x 1 vector of random values on {1,...,n}
%  
% If ind is specified
%   x(j)=i with probability p(i,ind(j))
% If ind is not specified
%   x(j)=i with probability p(i)   if p is a vector
%                           p(i,j) if q=m
