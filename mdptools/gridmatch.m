% gridmatch Finds the index of the nearest neighbor on a grid
% USAGE
%   ind=gridmatch(X,x);
% INPUTS
%   X : mxd matrix or d-element cell array composed of mx1 vectors
%   x : d-element cell array with element i an n(i)x1 vector
% OUTPUT
%   ind : mx1 vector of index values on {1,...,prod(n))
%         if XX=rectgrid(x) then XX(ind,:) is the
%         nearest neighbor on the grid to X.
