MDPSOLVE CHANGE LOG
Changes marked with a * indicate a bug fix or other change that could cause changes in the behavior
of existing code. Other changes are either new features or changes to the documentation contained in the code.

7/23/15*  minor bug fix in ampdpassive   

6/3/15    improved performance of xpomdpsim - now uses less memory and exhibits speed improvements

4/14/15*  fixed bug in dompurge.c used by pomdpsolve (incremental pruning algorithm for POMDPs). A new 64 bit MEX file was               created (the 32 bit version was not affected by the bug)

4/14/15   Added a transpose feature into ckronx and updated documentation

3/20/15*  fixed a bug in d2model that computed models incorrectly when parameter uncertainty is present and a
          conditional expectation function approach was requested

2/24/15*  fixed minor bugs in drawdiagram

2/18/15   added evalstrategy and getstrategies (see on-line documentation)

2/28/14   New version with many new features described in the enhancements document.

8/30/13*  Fixed bug in kronrow.c that made the 64 bit version crash. This utility is not often used.
          It's companion kroncol did not have the bug.

12/20/12  edited mdpsolve_Inf_Stage lines 113-114 to remove checks during run because a P matrix size error is
          incorrectly generated if ns changes across stages

          edited mdp_unpack lines 378-390 to pass the correct value of ns to checkP

1/22/12   Corrected a bug in mdp_checks that produced an incorrect error message when problems arose with the EV function.

11/22/11  Added a check to mdpsolve to check for the presence of NaNs in transition matrix. This can result, for example, from
          a 0/0 operation.   

11/22/11* Changed g2P so g function is passed a q-element row vector of noise terms by default. 
          Previously this row vector was expanded to be kxq matrix with each row the same. This can still be
          obtained by setting options.expande=1.

11/21/11* Corrected amdp to append the belief states to the augmented state action combinations (Xb)

7/24/11  Altered simplexbas to make the indexing consistent with the way simplexindex is written.

7/23/11  Altered simplexindex to use multiset table in standard order. This makes it consistent with the mex files and
           other programs that using simplex indexing. It also allows the table of multiset coefficients to be precomputed
           and passed into simplexindex (for many repeated calls with the same values of q and p this cas be a big time saver).
           Finally it allows the inputs to be of any type and handles 64 indexing.

7/23/11  Altered the algorithm used by simplexgrid to avoid unecessary out-of-memory errors. Also to allow the user 
           to pre-specify the data type.

7/23/11  Modified match to allow non-double inputs - this uses the m-file version as integer data types are not
           supported by the kdtree procedures.

7/21/11  Added the EV option to modified policy iteration (for non-staged models only). If the EV function allows
           two input arguments the current option policy vector is passed and an ns vector (rather than an nx vector)
           should be returned.

7/21/11  Added warning 51 to mdpreport ("Policy iteration not implemented with EV option")

7/11/11  Added a feature to catcountP to create a sparse matrix. 

7/4/11   Added the possability of passing a function to mergeP to compute a conditional transition matrix.
           This has the potential to save memory because all of the conditional matrices do not have to be
           stored. The procedure still could encounter problems with memory in sparse matrix situations.

7/2/11*  Edited multisum to pass double rather than uint32 data type to probabiity function. Due to
           Matlab's limited support for integer data types, this will prevent problems that could
           arise if evaluating a unit probability matrix that depends on X. Also changed catcountP to
           ensure the same behavior.

7/1/11   Added an additional feature of mfpt to compute the mean first passage time before a specified
           set of states is reached. Also allows for column or row stochastic matrices. If a matrix
           is doubley stochastic mfpt assumes that rows are associated with current states but a
           warning is printed.

6/27/11  Made rectbas and freudenthal both have a cleanup option that matches the one passed to g2P
           which now has 3 options (0/1/2). The 2 value truncates each point so no extrapolation occurs. 
           The old value of noextrap for rectbas still works as before.
           Similarly cleanup works the same in g2P but passing a value of 2 provides the new option.

6/27/11  Added the procedure mergeP to the mdptools directory. This is a simplification and
           replacement for mergestates which is made obsolete and will not be supported.

6/25/11  Added a warning in f2P if the P matrix created has NaNs (these can occur due to 0/0
           operations). Also added a check for 0 column sums and a warning about this.

6/25/11  Added an additional argument to simplex grid to specify restrictions on the maximum value
           in each column.

6/24/11  Changed getI to take a third argument and use match. Added warning to documentation about
           possability that indices are incorrect if there are omitted values.

6/24/11  Replaced match with a call to the kdtree utilities of Steven Michael (smichael@ll.mit.edu)
           which are now provided as a subdirectory of the mdputils directory. Also changed the 
           m-code version of match to use Yi Cao's fast m-code implementation.

6/23/11* Fixed catcountP to handle case when n>m. Also added an option to return P as a cell array
            with each element containing a column of P (only implemented if MEX file getpzc is used)

6/19/11  Fixed minor typo in documentation of pomdp

6/19/11  Added amdpDir to mdptools directory - this implements the Multinomial-Dirichlet approach to 
           adaptive management. The User's Guide has not been updated however.

6/18/11  Added MEX version of icdfbeta to probability folder because Matlab's betainc is slow and also
           not part of the basic MATLAB language (it is in the Statistics Toolbox). Note the m-file
           version of icdfbeta still calls betainc.

6/18/11* Changed rectbas so it accepts logical values for evenspacing

6/18/11  Added a check to qnwnorm for positive definitness of the covariance matrix and adjusted the output
           if this fails. The check requires that sqrtm(V) is real. If not x is set to real(z*sqrtm(V)).

6/12/11* Changed catcountP to avoid log of 0 warnings. Also changed multisum to handle -inf*0 issue 
           differntly (now -inf in logp is converted to -realmax so exp(x*logp)=1 if x=0 and 0 otherwise).

6/11/11  Added qnwnormeven to probability directory. This function get quadrature nodes and weights
           for the normal distribution that are evenly spaced and ensure that the normalized variance
           is close to 1. 

6/10/11  Added a scale parameter to qnwgamma and the option to input the mean and variance
           rather than the shape and scale parameters. The documentation was edited to describe 
           the changes.

6/9/11* Fixed an error check bug in mdpsolve_Fin_stage.

6/9/11  Fixed the undocumented overwrite feature in add2sparse (still undocumented as it has 
          not been adequately tested).

6/9/11* Fixed display bug in mdpreport.

6/9/11* Added a workaround version of fprintf to address the fact that MATLAB no longer allows
          sparse arguments to be passed to fprintf. The workaround version should act just like
          the builtin function except it tries to convert sparse inputs to full.

6/9/11  Added two plotting utilities to \mdputils: patchplot and drawgrid.

6/9/11* Changed longrunP so the negative elements warning is a simple display and applied the cleanup feature
          that sets the negative elements to 0 and normalizes so columns sum to 1.

6/8/11  Added documentary comments to longrunP to explain the options.
